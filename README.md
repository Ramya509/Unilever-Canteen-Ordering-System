# Unilever-Canteen-Ordering-System
Unilever's UK office has 1500 employees and two canteens seating 150 each. Most prefer lunch between 12-1 pm, causing long waits and food shortages, wasting 30-35 minutes. Employees spend only 10-15 minutes eating, with the rest spent waiting or commuting. They request an online meal ordering system for timely deliveries to reduce waiting and waste
# Unilever Canteen Ordering System

## Project Overview
Unilever is a British-Dutch MNC FMCG company, headquartered in London, England. With around 1500 employees spread across 12 floors in its UK offices, Unilever faces challenges in managing its two canteens, each with a seating capacity of 150. During peak lunch hours (12 noon to 1 pm), employees experience long waits for tables and food, leading to significant time wastage. This project aims to implement an online meal ordering system to streamline the canteen operations and improve employee productivity.
