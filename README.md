# Unilever-Canteen-Ordering-System
Unilever's UK office has 1500 employees and two canteens seating 150 each. Most prefer lunch between 12-1 pm, causing long waits and food shortages, wasting 30-35 minutes. Employees spend only 10-15 minutes eating, with the rest spent waiting or commuting. They request an online meal ordering system for timely deliveries to reduce waiting and waste
